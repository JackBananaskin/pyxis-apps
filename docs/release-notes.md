# Pyxis SDK Release Notes

## Version 0.2.2 (2020-04-22)

### Wi-Fi Management API
Wi-Fi settings can now be managed in user applications through pyxis.wlan object.

### Mock Pyxis APIs
You can now use pyxis.* objects while testing on your development host machine. 
For this, import our API library into your HTML:
```html
<script src="https://pyxis-api.renetec.io/js/pyxis-api-core.js"></script> 
```
this will add mock functions with hardcoded dummy return values, allowing for basic testing. You donâ€™t need to worry 
about this dependency when copying to the target hardware as it will be automatically replaced by a real API library in run-time, without fetching anything from the internet.

### Application description
Description can now be added to every application through the `desc` field in the application manifest, app.yaml.

### Source code of example applications
You can use example applications, including the Settings application, as a starting point for your development. 
Their source code is available from our GitHub repository, 
[github.com/renetec-io/pyxis-apps](https://github.com/renetec-io/pyxis-apps).

## Version 0.1.11 (2020-04-01)

### API usage examples
We added examples of using our API for FIFO pipes, UART serial port, and GPIO. The examples are accessible from the 
Settings application.

### HW accelerated 3D graphics
GPU-based rendering is now available, improving user interface responsiveness and allowing rendering of WebGL scenes.
